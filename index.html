Step 33

For the last step in the hotel feedback form workshop, you will need to add a submit button to the form.

Remember that you learned how to work submit buttons in previous lessons.

Add a button element with the type attribute set to "submit" and the text content set to Submit.

And with that, your hotel feedback form is complete!
